# Teyu(手湯)

A Ruby class extension for binding initialize method args to instance vars.  
Inspired by [attr_extras](https://github.com/barsoom/attr_extras) gem.

Teyu(手湯) is hand bath at Yugawara station.  
I scratched this gem in Yugawara hot spring hotel.

## Usage

`teyu_init` defines `initialize` method and binds args to same name instance variables.

```ruby
require 'teyu'

class Foo
  extend Teyu
  teyu_init :a, :b

  # Equal to...
  # def initialize(a, b)
  #   @a = a
  #   @b = b
  # end
end

class Bar
  extend Teyu
  teyu_init :c, :d!

  # def initialize(c, d:)
  #   @c = c
  #   @d = d
  # end
end

class Baz
  extend Teyu
  teyu_init :e, f: 'fff'

  # def initialize(e, f: 'fff')
  #   @e = e
  #   @f = f
  # end
end
```
